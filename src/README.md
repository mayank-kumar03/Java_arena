# ☕ Java Learning Journey — From Basics to Advanced

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**!  
This repository documents my complete journey of learning **Java**, from the **core fundamentals** to **advanced concepts** like **Multithreading**, **Lambda Expressions**, and the **Collection Framework**.

---

## 📘 Learning Roadmap

### 1️⃣ Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Understanding Classes, Objects, and Methods
- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Real-world examples of OOP concepts

### 2️⃣ Inheritance
- Types of inheritance in Java
- The `super` keyword and method overriding
- Constructor chaining and hierarchical inheritance
- Importance of reusability through inheritance

### 3️⃣ Abstract Classes
- Defining abstract classes and abstract methods
- Difference between abstract class and interface
- When and why to use abstract classes

### 4️⃣ Interfaces
- Declaring and implementing interfaces
- Achieving multiple inheritance using interfaces
- Functional interfaces and `default` methods in Java 8+

### 5️⃣ Inner Classes
- Member inner classes and static nested classes
- Local and anonymous inner classes
- Use cases and access control of inner classes

### 6️⃣ Static and Final
- Static variables, methods, and blocks
- Final classes, methods, and variables
- Constant declaration and immutability in Java

### 7️⃣ Packages
- Creating and organizing packages for modular code
- Importing classes and handling naming conflicts
- Access modifiers and package-level visibility

### 8️⃣ Exception Handling
- Handling runtime errors using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`
- Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
- Creating custom exceptions for better control

### 9️⃣ Multithreading
- Creating threads using `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface
- Thread lifecycle, synchronization, and inter-thread communication
- Thread priorities and concurrency concepts

### 🔟 Java.lang Package
- Exploring core classes: `Object`, `String`, `Math`, `System`, and `Wrapper` classes
- Commonly used methods from `java.lang`
- Understanding automatic boxing and unboxing

### 11️⃣ Lambda Expression
- Introduction to functional programming in Java
- Syntax and use cases of lambda expressions
- Functional interfaces and lambda-based event handling

### 12️⃣ Java Generics
- Ensuring type safety using generics
- Generic classes, methods, and bounded type parameters
- Wildcards (`? extends`, `? super`) and their real-world use cases

### 13️⃣ Collection Framework
- Introduction to `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and `Queue` interfaces
- Understanding `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `TreeSet`, etc.
- Iterators, Comparators, and sorting techniques

## 💻 Practice Folders

### 🧠 Java Implementation
- Real-world examples applying OOP, inheritance, and collection concepts
- Small projects to reinforce learning

### 📋 List
- Hands-on examples using `List` and its implementations (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`)
- CRUD operations and iteration techniques

---

## 🚀 Learning Goals

- Build a strong foundation in **Core Java**
- Master **OOP principles** and apply them effectively
- Develop efficient, readable, and scalable Java code
- Prepare for **technical interviews** and **real-world software development**
